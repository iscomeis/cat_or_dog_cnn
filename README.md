# **Is It Cat or Dog?**

In this project, we aim to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Leveraging the ["Dogs vs Cats" dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/overview), we will explore various stages of machine learning development, including data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

### Workflow Overview:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for analysis and model training by utilizing `ImageDataGenerator` for efficient augmentation and scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize key aspects of the image data to gain insights and validate preprocessing steps.
3. **Model Development**: Build and train a deep learning CNN architecture to distinguish between cat and dog images with high accuracy.
